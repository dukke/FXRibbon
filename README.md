## Controls used inside Ribbon
The controls used inside the ribbon (e.g. comboboxs, texfield, etc)  are based on JMetro, visit [http://www.pixelduke.com/jmetro](http://www.pixelduke.com/jmetro)
for more information.  
For now the option has been to, for the most commonly used controls inside the ribbon, have these styles available through this library and so avoid another dependency for most use cases. 

## Icons used on test apps
Kudos icons8 for the icons used in the sample apps, visit [https://icons8.com](https://icons8.com) for more information.
